        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: March 28, 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the privacy policy for the "PPT Finder" mobile application, developed by CoAxn Technology. This application is designed to help users find, download, and manage PPT files. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal data is handled securely. This Privacy Policy explains how we and our third-party partners collect, use, and share information when you use our app.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We and our third-party partners may collect the following types of information when you use the "PPT Finder" app:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device or Other IDs:</strong> We use Appodeal, a third-party ad network, to serve ads in the app. Appodeal may collect Device or Other IDs, such as the Advertising ID, to provide personalized ads and measure ad performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Approximate Location:</strong> Appodeal may collect approximate location data (e.g., based on your IP address) to serve location-based ads.</li>
            <li><strong>App Activity:</strong> Appodeal may collect data about your interactions with the app (e.g., ad impressions, clicks) for ad analytics.</li>
            <li><strong>Search History:</strong> The app collects search queries you enter to provide search functionality. This data is stored locally on your device and is not shared with third parties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not collect other personal or sensitive information, such as your name, email address, or precise location, unless explicitly provided by you.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information collected is used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App Functionality:</strong> To provide and improve the app’s core features, such as searching, downloading, and managing PPT files (e.g., using your search queries).</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> To serve personalized ads through Appodeal, which may use Device or Other IDs and approximate location for ad targeting.</li>
            <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> To personalize ad content based on your device information and app activity (via Appodeal).</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> To analyze ad performance and user engagement through Appodeal (e.g., tracking ad impressions and clicks).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties except as described below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Appodeal:</strong> We share Device or Other IDs, approximate location, and app activity with Appodeal to serve ads. Appodeal may share this data with its ad partners for advertising purposes. For more information, please see Appodeal’s privacy policy at <a href="https://www.appodeal.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://www.appodeal.com/privacy-policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not share your search history or other locally stored data with third parties.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We prioritize your privacy and data security. Data transmitted off-device (e.g., by Appodeal) is encrypted in transit using HTTPS. Locally stored data, such as your search history, is kept on your device and is not transmitted or shared.</p>

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>You can manage how your data is used in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opt Out of Personalized Ads:</strong> You can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device’s ad settings (e.g., disabling personalized ads in your Android settings). This may limit Appodeal’s use of the Advertising ID for ad personalization.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> You can disable location access for the app in your device settings to prevent Appodeal from collecting approximate location data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Compliance with Google Play Families Policy</h2>
        <p>We are committed to complying with the Google Play Families policy. Since the "PPT Finder" app targets an age group that includes children, we take extra care to ensure that our app is safe for all users. While the app itself does not collect personal data directly, third-party SDKs like Appodeal may collect certain data (as described above). We ensure that Appodeal’s data collection practices comply with applicable laws and policies, including those related to children’s privacy.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at coaxntechnology@gmail.com.</p>

        <p>Thank you for using "PPT Finder."</p>
